# ESP32 content

For now Mega 2560 version is made.  
The ESP-version is not tested and not included on github

The pin configuration needs to be determined on different ESP-boards.  
The interrupt pin must be identified and configured correctly.  

The code for Mega 2560 may work on ESP if the pin configuration is changed  
however this has not yet been tested on HW.
