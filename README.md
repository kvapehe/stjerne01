# stjerne01
stjerne01 inneholder en del kode for stjerne

## You may find the Norwegian language is used throughout the project.
This includes the source files. With some effort it should be possible for English speakert to understand the code

The idea is to collect several code used on a project on the school.
Main HW used is a Arduino Mega, but may also use an ESP 32 (Several types, main issue is number of available pins)

Lots of the code exist on WokWi and different HW uses different pin configuration

The different files in for sub folders may not be identical as the code has evolved 

Basically you find code to run 16 LED strips with 60 LED's on each strip.
The configuration uses 16 pins on the microcontroller to maintain all the strips.

A json-file is added to control the pins when used on WokWi, and in real life the HW need to be setup similar to the WokWi model.

The ino-file contains the current program.

These projects have been made.
- Red Green pattern (Used for Christmas)
- White Blue pattern with Fireworks (New Year)
- Orange Blue pattern (Company Visit)
- Yellow Green pattern (Easter Holiday) (Not the best version in colour choices and may be fixed later)
- May 17 pattern (Norway)
- Rainbow colour

- Missing patterns 6th February pattern, which is similar to Rainbow pattern
- Others... Time will tell.
